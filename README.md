# GI_InteractionTests
Genetic Interaction tests used to detect mutually exclusive and co-occurring altered gene pairs in childhood cancers.

For more details about both tests we refer to the accompanying paper **A comprehensive map of genetic interactions in childhood cancer reveals multiple underlying biological mechanisms** ([https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.17.385120v2.article-info](url)).

In the **wesme** and **permutation** directory you can find manuals how to run the tests on a local machine or on a hpc cluster.
